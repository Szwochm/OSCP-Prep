# Intent
These are notes on various topics while I prepare for the OSCP exam

These notes are not meant to be used to teach a class or do a presentation, and thus are not fully expanded. These are notes of things that I think may be useful to review in the future. Also I have already finished INE's System, and Information Gathering / Enumeration Sections, so there won't be notes here (I used Notion for those)
