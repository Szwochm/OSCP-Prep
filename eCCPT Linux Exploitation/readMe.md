Linux NFS shares directories using "exports". Exports can be found in `/etc/exports`

You can show all of the shared directories of a host by using `showmount -e <target>`

If you are able to mount it, you can do so using `mount -t nfs <ip>:/<mountable path> -o nolock`

nolock may be needed to connect to older NFS systems

Nfs uses advisory locking. This means the OS keeps track of which files are locked by process but does not stop them from writing to a locked file

Smb uses mandatory locking
