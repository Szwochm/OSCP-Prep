4.4.1 What is Executable Permission

 

https://www.studytonight.com/linux-guide/understanding-file-permissions-in-linux-unix

A permission of 755 is just the 3 groups of users permissions put into one

 

7 = 111 in binary

5 = 101 (1 + 4)

 

So by this logic there are 7 potential values

 

000, 001, 010, 100, 101, 110, 111

---  --r  -w-  r--  r-x  rw-  rwx

Touch can modify timestamps...

 

Using `touch file1 file2 file3` creates 3 files with the same timestamp.

 

touch -a <file> changes a file's access time. Note: The time shown in ll is the Modify date. There are 3 time stamps... Access Modify, Change

-a ccess

 

touch -c <file> only touches (updates timestamps) on files that already exists. Will not create a file.  (this makes sense, how can you change a file that doesn't exist?)

-c hange

 

touch -c-d <file> update access and modification time

 

touch -m <file> update mod time

-m odification

 

touch -d "dd Mon yyyy" <file>

-d ate

 

touch -r <source> <dest> copies timestamp from source file to dest file

 

Why would any of this matter?

 

Who can change the file permissions of a folder on Linux -- Answer Superuser or file owner

Follow up Question: can any super user do it or only super users with chmod enabled... I imagine only if you are given chmod in the sudoers file...

 

 

Very interesting concept presented...

We need the tool of chmod but cannot use it... we can simply make a copy of a file we do have access to (ls), replace its contents with chmod, and now we have a working chmod...

"Consider, on the other hand, that same learner with a Not Yet Mindset who thinks, for example, "I can't do the exercise yet", or "I can't understand the concepts yet.""

 

4.6.2 Knowing when you're ready

67 Pass rate = 41-50 pwk machines compromised

74 Pass rate = 51-60

85 Pass rate = 61-70 machines
