Critical Finds: https://osintframework.com/ -- Interesting mind map of how to perform OSINT with links to various tools

Note: With this Module I have introduce High Level Questions (HLQ). These point out information in the course I see that would be necessary at a management level... Things that should be known by CEOs, Contractors, Sales reps attempting to sell a product...

# 6. Information Gathering
GOal: Learn how to methodically map such an attack surface using both passive and active means

## 6.1 The Pen Test Lifecycle

Information gathering has a role within every stage of a pentest

HLQ: When should pentests be done? ---------- Routinely and after large shifts to IT architecture

Stages of a pentest
  Defining the Scope
  Information Gathering
  Vulnerability Detection
  Initial Foothold
  Privilege Escalation
  Lateral Movement
  Reporting/Analysis
  Lessons Learned/Remediation

HLQ: What does the scope of a pentest define: ---------- Which IP ranges, hosts, and applications should be test subjects during the engagement, as compared to out-of-scope items that should not be tested.

When we begin information gathering we are initially looking for information on the following things
A ssets
P ersonnel
I nfrastructure

"information gathering (also known as enumeration) does not end after our initial reconnaissance."

## 6.2 Passive Information Gathering

Learning Objectives:
Understand the two different Passive Information Gathering approaches
(OSINT)
Web Server and DNS passive information gathering

https://osintframework.com/

The ultimate goal of passive information gathering is to obtain information that clarifies or expands an attack surface

#6.2.1

https://www.megacorpone.com/ -- one of offsecs domains for PASSIVE Information Gathering
https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/what-is-a-name-server/
https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name-registrar/

Whois lookup of a hostname 
whois megacorpone.com -h 192.168.50.251 
(192.168.60.251 is Offsecs WHOIS server... Generally speaking companies WILL NOT have their own WHOIS server This is not a name server. Name servers resolve IPS and Hostnames. WhoIS servers provide information on the registration of domains)

Whois lookup of an Ip (AKA reverse lookup)
whois 38.100.193.70 -h 192.168.50.251

Using this command, they located the IT Admin's Name, and 3 name servers (NS1.MEGACORPONE.COM)

  Attack Surface Analysis --  The point of Attack Surface Analysis is to understand the risk areas in an application, to make developers and security specialists aware of what parts of the application are open to attack, to find ways of minimizing this, and to notice when and how the Attack Surface changes and what this means from a risk perspective.
  Attack Surface Analysis is usually done by security architects and pen testers
     This helps you do the following:
     Identify what needs to be reviewed or tested
     Identify high risk areas that will need defense in depth implemented
     Identify when you have changed the attack surface and need to do a threat assessment
     Attack Surface for an app is basically all of paths for data / commands into and out of and app, valuable data (Secrets, PII, etc), and code that attempts to protect the former
       Should be done for every user type but focus on how the webapp reacts to unauthenticated anonymous users and highly privileged admin users
       Group types of attacks in buckets based on risk
       Dont need to understand every endpoint. Just use the number of endpoints with their buckets to figure out how much of the budget has to go where

    Attack Surface for Microservices and Cloud Native Applicatios (I think these are basically just web apps)
      User interface (UI) forms and fields 
      HTTP headers and cookies
      APIs
      Files
      Databases
      Other local storage
      Email or other kinds of messages
      Runtime arguments
      ...Your points of entry/exit

    Identify high risk code
      Network-facing, especially internet-facing code
      Web forms
      Files from outside of the network
      Backward compatible interfaces with other systems – old protocols, sometimes old code and libraries, hard to maintain and test multiple versions
      Custom APIs – protocols etc – likely to have mistakes in design and implementation
      Security code: anything to do with cryptography, authentication, authorization (access control) and session management

There are tools for vuln scanning webapps (I don't think any of these are allowed on OSCP)
  - OWASP ZAP 
  - Arachni
  - Skipfish
  - w3af

6.2.1 Whois Enumeration

 https://www.domaintools.com/support/what-is-whois-information-and-why-is-it-valuable/
  
  Whois is a widely used Internet record listing that identifies who owns a domain and how to get in contact with them.
  Whois record changes can take a while (About 24 Hours)
  Not all extensions are equal. dot US do not have the option to privatize their information. ICANN no longer posts details of .ca domains. (However companies must still publicize it)
  
   
  
https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/what-is-a-name-server/
  
  Name servers connect specific URLs with the correct internet protocol (IP) address of the site’s server. (It doesn't mention IPv4 or Ipv6 nor which one specifically)
  Imagine that Name servers are the library, and DNS records are the catalog
  Each webhost has a different process for updating DNS records
  Name servers do not have to be related to the domain.
  
   
  
  Windows
  
  nslookup
  set q = ns
  <Enter a domain>
  
   
  
  for Linux/mac use dig
