# 3. Intro to Cyber

## 3.1 The Practice of Cybersecurity

### 3.1.1 Challenges in Cyber Security

Key topics

reasoning under uncertainty -- We will never know every single detail. Using experience and our tools we have to use our best judgement to select the best path ahead. "Predictions based on incomplete data"

The enemy is human -- Offsec says that our enemy (and allies) is human... I'm not sure I agree with that anymore.

Cyber security poses dynamic challenges. To beat these challenges we will have to adapt our mindsets


### 3.1.2 A word on Mindsets

Bruce Schneier - The Security Mindset - https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html

Excerpt from above link that explains it really well
""Security requires a particular mindset. Security professionals—at least the good ones—see the world differently.
They can’t walk into a store without noticing how they might shoplift. 
They can’t use a computer without wondering about the security vulnerabilities. 
They can’t vote without trying to figure out how to vote twice. They just can’t help it."

OSCP - Try Harder Mindset - https://www.offsec.com/blog/what-it-means-to-try-harder/
Step 1: Figure out why or how a particular approach is failing. This will lead to new approaches and new ideas.
Step 2: Patience "Try again"
Step 3: Creativity -- Not a stab in the dark, "Try differently"
Step 3: Perceptivity -- "Try smarter"

### 3.1.3 Emulating the minds of our Opponenets

"How might an attacker gain access?"
"What can they do with that access?" -" What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

## 3.2 Threat and Threat Actors

### 3.2.2 Threats and Threat Actors
This covers more of stuff you would see an in interview, things like the difference between a risk, threat and vulnerability

risk: the probability that a negative event will occur, and the impact on something we value if such an event happens.
threat: Someone or thing poses a risk
vulnerability: Some flaw or weakness existing
exploit: the usage of a vulnerability or something that takes advantage of a vulnerability
attack surface: all the points of contact on our system or network that could be vulnerable to exploitation
attack vector: specific vulnerability and exploitation combination that can further a threat actor's objectives.

A way to interpret risks (this is commonly used in IT to triage service requests)

Low-probability, low impact events
Low-probability, high impact events
High-probability, low impact events
High-probability, high impact events

They talk about Log4J briefly

### 3.2.3 Threat Actor Classifications
This section just defines and gives examples of the following... feel like the below is all I can add to my notes without violating copyrights

Individuals
Malicious groups
Insider
Nation States

## 3.3 The CIA Triad

Talks about the CIA triad -- one interesting thing they mentioned is that each aspects of the triad may be a potential goal to attack. Never thought of it this way!

The most important aspect of the triad depends on the overall goal of the company / person that is maintaining it...

My example 1: A CIA spy's must importat aspect would be Confidentiality... Information that is garbled or unaccessible can be a problem, but for example a Nation state reading the contents is vastly more dire.
My example 2: An emergency system / dispatch most important aspect would be Availability on the other hand... You don't want strangers reading whats happening at another area, but it being available is much more important

### 3.3.1 Confidentiality
"A system is Confidential if the only people who can access it are the people explicitly permitted to do so."

Two examples of attacks on confidentiality

 Network eavesdropping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_eavesdropping
  - Most dangerous for industries that rely on collection and storing data

 Credential Stuffing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing)
  - Literally just re-using found credentials to try to get into other accounts. They use the mapping or pairing of user names and passwords. In otherwords, they don't brute force every username with every password, they keep the pairs together and just try them all
  - 2% hit rate globally

### 3.3.2 Integrity
Integrity - Only the information and functionality that is intended to be stored, is stored
  - Example of attack on integrity is Arbitrary code execution

Whisper Gate
  Microsoft (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)
  CrowdStrike (https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/technical-analysis-of-whispergate-malware/)
  - Virus pretends to be ransomware but actually just overwrites data at given offsets so recovery is impossible
  - Overwrites the MBR
  - Similar to NotPetya which also targeted Ukraine

### 3.3.3 Availability
"A system is considered Available if the people who are supposed to access it can do so"
Examples - DDOS
Talks about Via Sat

### 3.3.4
Lab questions, nothing further

## 3.4 Security Principles, Controls, and Strategies

Extra Reading
3.4.1
Security Principals
https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/follow-good-principles.html
- Least Privilege
- Simplicity / Kiss
- Open Design (More eyes to find vulns, transparancy to the end-user)
- Complete Mediation - Mechanisms to check every single access attempt, and in a way that these mechanisms cannot be bypassed.
- Fail safe Defaults - Think about a Deny Deny rule on a firewall as the default.
- Separation of privilege 
- Least Common Mechanism - minimize amount and use of shared mechanisms. 
- Psycholigocal Acceptability / Ease to use - basically if the security sucks (in an inconvenient way), users will find ways to bypass it
