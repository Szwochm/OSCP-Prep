# 3. Intro to Cyber

## 3.1 The Practice of Cybersecurity

### 3.1.1 Challenges in Cyber Security

Key topics

reasoning under uncertainty -- We will never know every single detail. Using experience and our tools we have to use our best judgement to select the best path ahead. "Predictions based on incomplete data"

The enemy is human -- Offsec says that our enemy (and allies) is human... I'm not sure I agree with that anymore.

Cyber security poses dynamic challenges. To beat these challenges we will have to adapt our mindsets


### 3.1.2 A word on Mindsets

Bruce Schneier - The Security Mindset - https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html

Excerpt from above link that explains it really well
""Security requires a particular mindset. Security professionals—at least the good ones—see the world differently.
They can’t walk into a store without noticing how they might shoplift. 
They can’t use a computer without wondering about the security vulnerabilities. 
They can’t vote without trying to figure out how to vote twice. They just can’t help it."

OSCP - Try Harder Mindset - https://www.offsec.com/blog/what-it-means-to-try-harder/
Step 1: Figure out why or how a particular approach is failing. This will lead to new approaches and new ideas.
Step 2: Patience "Try again"
Step 3: Creativity -- Not a stab in the dark, "Try differently"
Step 3: Perceptivity -- "Try smarter"

### 3.1.3 Emulating the minds of our Opponenets

"How might an attacker gain access?"
"What can they do with that access?" -" What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

### 3.2.2 Threats and Threat Actors
This covers more of stuff you would see an in interview, things like the difference between a risk, threat and vulnerability

risk: the probability that a negative event will occur, and the impact on something we value if such an event happens.
threat: Someone or thing poses a risk
vulnerability: Some flaw or weakness existing
exploit: the usage of a vulnerability or something that takes advantage of a vulnerability
attack surface: all the points of contact on our system or network that could be vulnerable to exploitation
attack vector: specific vulnerability and exploitation combination that can further a threat actor's objectives.

A way to interpret risks (this is commonly used in IT to triage service requests)

Low-probability, low impact events
Low-probability, high impact events
High-probability, low impact events
High-probability, high impact events

They talk about Log4J briefly

### 3.2.3 Threat Actor Classifications
This section just defines and gives examples of the following... feel like the below is all I can add to my notes without violating copyrights

Individuals
Malicious groups
Insider
Nation States
