Note: Starting with section 3.4.1, I have created an extra section for all the various links Offsec provides throughout the reading. Links will be under their relevant section as well as the Extra reading section
# 3. Intro to Cyber

## 3.1 The Practice of Cybersecurity

### 3.1.1 Challenges in Cyber Security

Key topics

reasoning under uncertainty -- We will never know every single detail. Using experience and our tools we have to use our best judgement to select the best path ahead. "Predictions based on incomplete data"

The enemy is human -- Offsec says that our enemy (and allies) is human... I'm not sure I agree with that anymore.

Cyber security poses dynamic challenges. To beat these challenges we will have to adapt our mindsets


### 3.1.2 A word on Mindsets

Bruce Schneier - The Security Mindset - https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html

Excerpt from above link that explains it really well
""Security requires a particular mindset. Security professionals—at least the good ones—see the world differently.
They can’t walk into a store without noticing how they might shoplift. 
They can’t use a computer without wondering about the security vulnerabilities. 
They can’t vote without trying to figure out how to vote twice. They just can’t help it."

OSCP - Try Harder Mindset - https://www.offsec.com/blog/what-it-means-to-try-harder/
Step 1: Figure out why or how a particular approach is failing. This will lead to new approaches and new ideas.
Step 2: Patience "Try again"
Step 3: Creativity -- Not a stab in the dark, "Try differently"
Step 3: Perceptivity -- "Try smarter"

### 3.1.3 Emulating the minds of our Opponenets

"How might an attacker gain access?"
"What can they do with that access?" -" What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

## 3.2 Threat and Threat Actors

### 3.2.2 Threats and Threat Actors
This covers more of stuff you would see an in interview, things like the difference between a risk, threat and vulnerability

risk: the probability that a negative event will occur, and the impact on something we value if such an event happens.
threat: Someone or thing poses a risk
vulnerability: Some flaw or weakness existing
exploit: the usage of a vulnerability or something that takes advantage of a vulnerability
attack surface: all the points of contact on our system or network that could be vulnerable to exploitation
attack vector: specific vulnerability and exploitation combination that can further a threat actor's objectives.

A way to interpret risks (this is commonly used in IT to triage service requests)

Low-probability, low impact events
Low-probability, high impact events
High-probability, low impact events
High-probability, high impact events

They talk about Log4J briefly

### 3.2.3 Threat Actor Classifications
This section just defines and gives examples of the following... feel like the below is all I can add to my notes without violating copyrights

Individuals
Malicious groups
Insider
Nation States

## 3.3 The CIA Triad

Talks about the CIA triad -- one interesting thing they mentioned is that each aspects of the triad may be a potential goal to attack. Never thought of it this way!

The most important aspect of the triad depends on the overall goal of the company / person that is maintaining it...

My example 1: A CIA spy's must importat aspect would be Confidentiality... Information that is garbled or unaccessible can be a problem, but for example a Nation state reading the contents is vastly more dire.
My example 2: An emergency system / dispatch most important aspect would be Availability on the other hand... You don't want strangers reading whats happening at another area, but it being available is much more important

### 3.3.1 Confidentiality
"A system is Confidential if the only people who can access it are the people explicitly permitted to do so."

Two examples of attacks on confidentiality

 Network eavesdropping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_eavesdropping
  - Most dangerous for industries that rely on collection and storing data

 Credential Stuffing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing)
  - Literally just re-using found credentials to try to get into other accounts. They use the mapping or pairing of user names and passwords. In otherwords, they don't brute force every username with every password, they keep the pairs together and just try them all
  - 2% hit rate globally

### 3.3.2 Integrity
Integrity - Only the information and functionality that is intended to be stored, is stored
  - Example of attack on integrity is Arbitrary code execution

Whisper Gate
  Microsoft (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)
  CrowdStrike (https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/technical-analysis-of-whispergate-malware/)
  - Virus pretends to be ransomware but actually just overwrites data at given offsets so recovery is impossible
  - Overwrites the MBR
  - Similar to NotPetya which also targeted Ukraine

### 3.3.3 Availability
"A system is considered Available if the people who are supposed to access it can do so"
Examples - DDOS
Talks about Via Sat

### 3.3.4
Lab questions, nothing further

## 3.4.1 Security Principles
5 Elements of Zero Trust
 - Just in Time Access
 - Just Enough Access
 - Dynamic Access Control
 - Microsegmentation
 - tokenization and encrpytion to protect data

# 3.4.2
There is a lot of balancing that needs to be done depending on the goal. Security controls can be expensive, and cause DOS if a security mechanism becomes unavailable.

# 3.4.3 Shift-Left Security

Basically they just talk about the idea of building applications with security from the very start instead of trying to add it on after the fact.

Extra Reading
3.4.1
Security Principals
https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/follow-good-principles.html
List given by Saltzer [1974] and later Saltzer and Schroeder [1975]. Who are these nerds, and why does it matter what they think? These guys wrote the internet standards IEEE
 - Least Privilege
 - Simplicity / Kiss
 - Open Design (More eyes to find vulns, transparancy to the end-user)
 - Complete Mediation - Mechanisms to check every single access attempt, and in a way that these mechanisms cannot be bypassed.
 - Fail safe Defaults - Think about a Deny Deny rule on a firewall as the default.
 - Separation of privilege 
 - Least Common Mechanism - minimize amount and use of shared mechanisms. 
 - Psycholigocal Acceptability / Ease to use - basically if the security sucks (in an inconvenient way), users will find ways to bypass it

https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secure_Product_Design_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-principles
 Note: I will only cover the new principals unless this resource describes it in an novel way. 
 - Separation of duties (privilege) -- System of chceks and balances to ensure no single individual has control over all aspects of a transaction.
 - Defense in Depth -- multiple layers of security. If one wall fails, another will stand.
 - Zero trust -- slightly different perspective than least privilege. Least privilege = give users the least amount of power to do their job. Zero trust = everyone's a potential terrorist. Scan and monitor everything. Every single request must be authorized
 
 Security Focus areas (appears to be contextualized around secure coding)
 1. Context -- how and why is this app used? What type of data? What is the risk?
 2. Components -- Take the code apart into its modules, libraries, apis... How can we secure these parts?
 3. Connections --  can't explain and I don't think I need to for my purposes.
 4. Code -- Input validation, error handling, Authentication & Authorization, Cryptography in transit / at rest, Least privilege, Secure memory management, don't hard code secrets, security testing, keeping up to date with current standards

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege
Principle of least privilege
- applies to all accounts, services, apps not just users
- there is an actual non security benefit -- apps that follow this are easier to deploy. As devs have to hand pick which resources to use, certain drivers, installations may not have to be made.
- True least privilege is hard. Its hard to know when exactly a user will need a resource for exactly what thing, so generally a user is given a little more than they may need. Ex. a PC tech can remote into a user machine at any time. Following least privilege,
the pc tech should only be able to do so at a specified time. (This is my example, may not be 100% accurate)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model
Zero Trust Security Model
 - also known as Perimeterless Security
 - never trust, always verify
 - proposed to be used in areas such as supply chains (of software)

https://www.cyberark.com/what-is/just-in-time-access/
Just in Time Access (JITA)
 - Think of a security admin that can only install apps at 2pm on a certain day after requesting permission. They cannot install at 1pm the same day, or 2pm the next day. The power is only given at the exact time that they need it.

Types of Just intime access
Broker and remove access -  User's connect to targets via a broker. Shared privilege accounts
Ephermal accounts - accounts created on the fly, and then deleted
Temporary elevation - get sudo for a command for 15 minutes to install a software

Example -- Asking a sys admin to give access to a network share. Admin gives access. You upload files. Admin takes share away.

Just Enough Access

Principal in Identity and Access Management (IAM)
 - helps mitigate insider threats

https://venafi.com/blog/how-dynamic-authorization-enables-zero-trust-architecture/
Dynamic Authorizaiton / Access Control

Fundamentals of Zero Trust
-Default Deny
- Access by Policy only
- For data, workloads, users, devices

A dynamic authorization defines the relationship between identities – human identities and machine identities – and the digital assets to be accessed

- To manage dynamic authorizations you need PBACs (Policy based access control(s))

Key elements of an authorization policy

- Identity -- Who / What is trying to access
- Resource -- what is being accessed
- Device -- how is it being access
- Environmental conds -- Time, Date, Location
- Business Policies associated with role of identity
- compliance requirements

 Zero Trust is not just about authenticating and verifying identities. It is also about authorizing these identities to access the resources they are entitled to.

https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-microsegmentation
Microsegmentation

A workload is a computational task, process or data transaction.

Microsegmentation refers to an approach to security that involves dividing a network into segments and applying security controls to each segment based on the segment’s requirements.
These granular secure zones isolate workloads, securing them individually with custom, workload-specific policies.

3.4.2

Security Controls https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/security_control
This is just a dictionary page definition of the word security control with 15 refrences to NIST.

Kerberos https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/
A network authentication protocol
Uses Secret Key Cryptography ( type of encryption where a single secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message -- This a symmetic protocol )
There is a Free version available from MIT
Talks about how Firewalls are good at stopping securing against outside threats, but not against inside. I am sure there are exceptions for Next Gen stuff...
Kerberos allows secure authentication over an insecure network
Once authenticated via Kerberos, server and client communicate via encryption so can further send data without exposing it to the insecure network (This sounds like it kind of does what a VPN does...)
