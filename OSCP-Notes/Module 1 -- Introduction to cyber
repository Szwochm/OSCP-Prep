### 3.1.1 Challenges in Cyber Security

Key topics

reasoning under uncertainty -- We will never know every single detail. Using experience and our tools we have to use our best judgement to select the best path ahead. "Predictions based on incomplete data"

The enemy is human -- Offsec says that our enemy (and allies) is human... I'm not sure I agree with that anymore.

Cyber security poses dynamic challenges. To beat these challenges we will have to adapt our mindsets


### 3.1.2 A word on Mindsets

Bruce Schneier - The Security Mindset - https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html

Excerpt from above link that explains it really well
""Security requires a particular mindset. Security professionals—at least the good ones—see the world differently.
They can’t walk into a store without noticing how they might shoplift. 
They can’t use a computer without wondering about the security vulnerabilities. 
They can’t vote without trying to figure out how to vote twice. They just can’t help it."
