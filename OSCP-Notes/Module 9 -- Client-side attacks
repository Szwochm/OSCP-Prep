# 11 Client-side attacks
Most initial footholds are obtained by credential attacks and phishing attacks.

When we leverage client-side attacks in penetration tests, we must also consider the moral aspect of targeting users.
Our goal should not only be to obtain code execution on their system.
It is also to not overstep any ethical or legal boundaries such as blackmailing employees or impersonating the police.

Client systems are rarely exposed publically. Access can be gained with malicious attachments, websites, USB dropping, etc

It has become increasingly difficult to deliver payloads via email due to spam filters, firewalls,
and other security technologies scanning emails for links and attachments.

.lnk shortcuts can point to malicious resources

JScript executed via Windows Script host has been noted as a potential vector


## 11.1. Target Reconnaissance

Before executing a client side attack, identify potential users. Target and gather information about OS and installed software.

### 11.1.1 Information Gathering

metadata tags of publicaly-available documents may clue you into which verions of adobe, word, etc is being used,

Google Dork to Find pdfs hosted on a website
site:example.com filetype:pdf 

Exiftool displays metadata of basically every common filetype. There's a list on the website

exiftool -a -u brochure.pdf
-a: display duplicated tags
-u display unknown tags

offsec's client-side content was written in 2022

Author name can show employee names

11.2. Exploiting Microsoft Office

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

Understand variations of Microsoft Office client-side attacks
Install Microsoft Office
Leverage Microsoft Word Macros

11.2.1. Preparing the Attack

Using an attachment in an email for the attack isn't going to cut it. Too much awareness and mitigations are implemented. 

Files downloaded from email or links are marked with MOTW (Mark of the Web) -- This opens them in protected mode. A target must be convinced to "Enable editing" for macros to execute.

An attacker can blur the rest of the document and say that the user has to Enable Editing to trick them into clicking it...

There are some macro programs that do not have a protected view such as Microsoft Publisher.

If you see "Learn more" instead of "Enable content", files have to be unblocked using the macro unblock checkbox

Even with all of these hoops, macro attacks are still a very common client-side attack

Mark of the web can be bypassed. A compressed folder may be marked, but its contents may not.
MOTW is a NTFS, feature and does not support NTFS alternative data streams.
A NTFS data stream is similar to a pipe. (Pipes are used for inter-process communication, streams are just how the files are stored.)
Most files only have a main stream for reading and writing to a file, but can have alternate streams. These alternate streams can be used to bypass motw.
