Goals: Understanding Active Directory Authentication
       Performing Attacks on Active Directory Authentication

NTLM is used instead of Kerberos in one of the following situations
1) Client auths to server by IP instead of hostname
2) hostname is not registered in the AD's Dns server
3) 3rd party apps

fast-hashing algorithms are hashes that cannot be reveresed by can be cracked relatively quickly. Ntlm is one of these
