Learning Flow Ideas

Reading Sections
Read the section -> Copy all links for later reading -> Once finished with section, read every link and add notes under Extra Reading Section

Concerns:
I don't have a reviewing process built into this flow. Reviewing is very time consuming but also paramount for long term memory...

  How often should I review?
  Probably every 1-2 sections. Anything more than that and it becomes excessive and boring. Maybe Do Section 1, 2, 3, review 1, 4, review 2? Keep review sections to 10 minutes or less?


I think I will follow the following pattern

30 minutes new content
5 minute break
30 minute new content
5 minute break
10 minute review

Topics that have been reviewed will be marked by [x] 
I don't think I will review the extra reading unless it seems critical. Most of this reading (as of the first module) just helps build an overall picture, and encourage confidence in the main material.
