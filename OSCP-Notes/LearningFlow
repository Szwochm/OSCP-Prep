Learning Flow Ideas

Reading Sections
Read the section -> Copy all links for later reading -> Once finished with section, read every link and add notes under Extra Reading Section

Concerns:
I don't have a reviewing process built into this flow. Reviewing is very time consuming but also paramount for long term memory...

  How often should I review?
  Probably every 1-2 sections. Anything more than that and it becomes excessive and boring
