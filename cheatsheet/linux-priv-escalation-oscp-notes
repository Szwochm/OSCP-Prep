cat /etc/fstab

mount

lsblk

lsmod - list all kernel modules

list module info using /sbin/modinfo mod

group 0 is root, 42 is shadow.... Be careful if you change your accounts info, you may break your only foot-point. its better to just make a new account


sudo -l lets you check what this account can run as sudo, super useful!

check the following for potentially stored plain text creds... immediately try to do su - root as these are likely creds needed for higher privs scripts...

.bashrc

.bashanything really
